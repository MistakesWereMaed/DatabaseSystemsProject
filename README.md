# DatabaseSystemsProject

## Overview

This project aims to develop a MySQL database system for managing trouble ticketing information of a company that dispatches technicians to resolve customer-reported problems. The database will help dispatchers and technicians properly identify problems and efficiently allocate resources to resolve them. The project is proposed by Thomas Burns, Isaac Garza, Julian Legere, and Benjamin Samuel.

## Project Proposal

The proposed database will include the following key features:

- **Ticket ID**: A numeric identifier for each trouble ticket.
- **Problem Description**: A field to describe the reported problem in detail.
- **Problem Location**: A set of predefined values that specify the location of the reported problem.
- **Location Subcategory**: A set of predefined values that further categorize the location of the reported problem.
- **Date Created**: A date field indicating when the trouble ticket was created.

The database will be designed to store and manage information related to trouble tickets efficiently. It will facilitate the tracking of issues reported by customers and the allocation of resources to resolve them promptly.

## Project Scope

The scope of the project includes the following tasks:

- Designing the database schema to accommodate the required fields and relationships.
- Implementing SQL queries and scripts to create and manage the database.
- Developing a user interface for data entry and retrieval.
- Testing the database system to ensure functionality and performance.
- Deploying the database system for use by dispatchers and technicians.

## Project Significance

The project is significant because it addresses the need for an efficient system to manage trouble-ticketing information in a company that dispatches technicians. By analyzing data stored in the database, the company can identify patterns and trends in reported problems, enabling proactive measures to address systemic issues.

## Note

Due to the proprietary nature of the data, this project will likely utilize existing information from a data hosting website rather than publicly available data. Therefore, the database will not be accessible to the public.
